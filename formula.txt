6.1037. Valid Boomerang
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-boomerang/description/
Calculate the slopes between consecutive pairs of points:
For (x1, y1) to (x2, y2): slope1 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
For (x2, y2) to (x3, y3): slope2 = (y3 - y2) / (x3 - x2)
If the slopes are not equal, the points are not collinear and hence form a boomerang.
But there is a corner case of division by zero. So, cross multiply the denominators of the slopes and check equality of:
                (y2-y1)*(x3-x2) != (y3-y2)*(x2-x1)
